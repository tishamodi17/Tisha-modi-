4. Eager Loading vs. Lazy Loading
Lazy Loading (Default)

    Loads relationships only when accessed.

$employees = Employee::all(); // Employees fetched
foreach ($employees as $employee) {
    echo $employee->projects; // Loads projects individually (N+1 issue)
}

Eager Loading (Recommended)

    Loads relationships in one query to avoid N+1 problem.

$employees = Employee::with('projects')->get();
