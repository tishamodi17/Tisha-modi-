 2. CRUD Operations Using Eloquent

Eloquent simplifies CRUD operations:
Create (Insert Record)

Employee::create([
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => 'john@example.com',
    'position' => 'Developer',
    'salary' => 60000,
]);

Read (Retrieve Records)

$employees = Employee::all(); // Get all employees
$employee = Employee::find(1); // Find by ID

Update (Modify Record)

$employee = Employee::find(1);
$employee->salary = 70000;
$employee->save();

Delete (Remove Record)

Employee::destroy(1);
