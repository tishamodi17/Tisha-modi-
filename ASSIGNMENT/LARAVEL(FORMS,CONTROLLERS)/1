1. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) in Laravel

Laravel's ORM is called Eloquent, which allows interacting with the database using models instead of writing raw SQL queries.
Example: Defining an Eloquent Model

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Employee extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    protected $fillable = ['name', 'email', 'position', 'salary'];
}

Here, the $fillable array ensures mass assignment protection.
